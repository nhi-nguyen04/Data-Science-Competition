#STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

# -----------  ----------- Clarify Objectives & Business Impact: 
# Task Type: Classification
# Participants are asked to predict whether individuals received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, making it a binary classification task for each vaccine:
#   
# Target values: 0 (did not receive the vaccine) or 1 (did receive the vaccine).

#The aim is to understand which factors are associated with vaccine uptake, which can support public health campaigns and policies
# Success means building a model that can accurately predict vaccination status for both H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. More specifically:
#   
#   Your predictions should score well based on the evaluation metric used (e.g., log loss).
# 
# A successful submission would identify key predictors of vaccination behavior and perform well on the private leaderboard.
